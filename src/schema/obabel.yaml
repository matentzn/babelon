slots:
  predicate_id:
    description: >-
      The predicate / annotation property used to relate the translated value at the source ontolgy.
      For example: rdfs:label, oio:exactSynonym, dc:description
  translation_value:
    description: The translation of the source value int the translation language. For example the french name of a disease.
    range: string
  source_value:
    description: The value that is being translated, for example the definition of a disease or the name of a cell type.
    range: string
  subject_id:
    description: The id of the entity to which the source value belongs, i.e. the subject of the annotation, for example HP:0000001.
    range: string
  source_language:
    description: The language code of the source value, for example en-GB (see http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).
    range: string
  translation_language:
    description: The language code of the translated value, for example fr (see http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).
    range: string
  source:
    description: The persistent identifier of the source, for example http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.owl.
    range: string
  source_version:
    description: The version of the source used for the translation, for example http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp/releases/2021-04-13/hp.owl.
    range: string
  translator:
    description: The entity that performed the translation, for example https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1373-XXXX or https://translate.google.com/
    range: string
  translation_type:
    description: "The type of translation, for example: Manual, Tool."
    range: string
  translation_date:
    description: The date the translation was performed.
    range: string
  translation_confidence:
    description: A score between 0 and 1 to denote the degree of certainty the translator has with regards to the translation of the source value into the translation value, given a particular level of precision. For example, the translation may have precision "narrow" or "broad" rather than "exact", but the confidence that this is right may still be 100% (1.0).
    range: double
  translation_precision:
    description: While by default, all translations are assumed to be exact, this is not possible in all cases. Where the translations cant be exact, they can be close, narrow or broad.
    range: string
  translation_provider:
    description: The entity, i.e. person or group, that provides and maintains the translation profile.
    range: string
